# Ariel Aram

Hello, I am Ariel Aram.

- 18 Years Old Male

- Birthday: 2008-02-19

- Autism and ADHD

- Kumon Trainee

- Basic Python Knowledge

- Founder of Nationdex.bot

- Retired Admin of Scorpceltic Empire

My Discord username is **arielaram**, and my Signal username is **arielaram.01**. You can join the [Nationdex server](https://discord.gg/tKh3n5uVnm) to play with one of the oldest dex bots in the entire Ballsdex community.

The developers at my project are working on a Nationdex TypeScript codebase with compatibility for the Ballsdex database and enhanced dex features. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Nationdex-Team/Nationdex.bot).

You can also access the official [Nationdex website](https://nationdex.com), which is not available at the moment, as well as my own portfolio [here](https://arielaram.com).

## Curiosities

- I have three kittens, the male is called "Pitico", the female is called "Alicia", and the second male is called "Tumtum".

- I am a big fan of Sonic the Hedgehog, and I have a cute Cream the Rabbit plushie, which Youssif decided to use for his profile picture.

- My Discord account is from 2018 and it has been created while I was interacting online with my nephew during a vacation of mine, but I only started using it back in 2022 when I joined the SHN Games server for a beta version of their upcoming game "Countryballs at War (CaW)", and later on, I met my first online friend Gerbica, so I have officially joined the Countryballs community through Discord.

- Although I have started using Discord back in 2022, I was using Discord with another identity with the name "Windows Macro" after joining the chaotic Windows community and making a YouTube channel with stupid Kinemaster videos, but I later abandoned it without any traces and my disappearance was a mystery for many people in there, until I've revealed the truth about my identity and the reason for my resignment from that community, which was the moment I reencountered with old friends such as Windows 8 For The Win (aka CV), together with who once was my bestie before I left the community, Windows 8 Pro.

- I used to be so childish that people at SHN Games were sick and tired of me back then, which caused me to be banned from the server, but as the years passed, I have become more mature and I am currently the founder of a dex bot named "Nationdex.bot", which is going to have a open-source TypeScript codebase soon.

- I hate noisy environments so badly, to the point where I even get jumpscared by innocent birds, so I prefer using a ear protector when I leave my soundproof bedroom.

- My involvement in dramas were insane back in 2023-2024, to the point where I even got banned from Ballsdex, due to a drama of mine between me, Calvo, Bic, and Maxim in AsiaDex. Later on, I realized what I have done to Bic and I gave him my sincere apologies, which he finally forgave me and accepted my appeal, but Flare literally re-banned me from the Ballsdex server without giving a clear reason, even when I requested him to do so, on my last appeal. Yeah, I have cleaned a lot of my past history and I have not just improved my behavior over time, but I also got a trainee job at Kumon and some programming courses in a tech college of mine.

- Nationdex has the vastest cultural history in the whole dex community, as it has been engulfed in several dramas, but at the same time, it has been one of the oldest and most ambitious dexes in there, with over 2K guilds, something which I find impressive, even for myself, and I truly wish to revive the essence of this dex, through the power of teamwork and friendship.
